		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>
			In Homework 2, we focused on geometric modeling. We first started with Bezier curves and surfaces, a commonly 
			utilized way to model smooth surfaces in computer graphics. We implemented these using De Casteljau's Algorithm, 
			a recursive way to implement Bezier curves and surfaces. Next, we worked with triangle meshes and the halfedge data 
			structure. We started by implementing area-weighted vertex normals. We used this for Phong shading, a method of shading
			that provides better shading than default flat shading for smooth surfaces. Afterwards, we implemented edge flips. An edge
			flip works by taking a pair of triangles that share an edge and replacing that original edge with a new edge drawn across
			the other two vertices of the triangles. Next, we implemented edge splits. Edge splits take a pair of adjacent triangles,
			calculating the midpoint of the shared edge, and adding two new edges from the other vertices to the midpoint. Finally,
			we implemented loop subdivision for mesh sampling, which converts a coarse polygon mesh into a higher resolution one by
			using an upsampling algorithm to upsample. Something interesting that we learned about this project was how small changes in 
			the mesh, such as edge flips and splits, can significantly impact the final shape and smoothness of the model. This
			homework also emphasized the importance and power of the halfedge data structure in meshes.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		
		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that is used to evaluate polynomials via liner intepolation. More 
			specifically, it can be used to evaluate Bezier curves. We implemented it in the <code>evaluateStep()</code> method by first 
			creating a 2D Vector to store our new intermediary points. Then, we used a for loop, starting at 0 and looping up to 
			<code>points.size() - 1</code> times. This ensures we are working on one less point with each recursive call, allowing us to 
			eventually converge at a singular point. For each pair of adjacent points in the for loop and a given parameter <code>t</code>, 
			we find the linear interpolation of the two points using \( (1 - t) \cdot p_i + t \cdot p_{i+1} \). We then add this point to our 2D Vector.
			Once the for loop has terminated, we return our vector. By pressing <code>E</code> in our GUI, we step along each call of our 
			recursive function. Once pressing <code>E</code> causes the red point to appear, we have reached our base case and evaluated our
			Bezier curve at a single point.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		
		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm applies to Bezier surfaces because instead of working along a one dimensional curve, we are 
			now working along a two dimensional surface. We accomplish this by using de Casteljau's algorithm twice; first along 
			<code>u</code> as one of our parameters and then along <code>t</code> as our other parameter. For this task, we
			implemented de Casteljau's algorithm by applying the algorithm (using the <code>evaluate1D()</code> method) for each row 
			of our <code>n x n</code> control points with parameter <code>u</code>. Each point is added to a Vector3D. After we 
			finish evaluating each row, we then evaluate the Vector3D with parameter <code>v</code> using <code>evaluate1D()</code>.
			<code>evaluate1D()</code> works by taking a vector of points and a parameter and calling <code>evaluateStep()</code> until
			we are left with our final, interpolated point that was represented by the red point in Task 1.

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		
		<p>
			For this task, we implemented area-weighted vertex normals by first defining our variables: <code>HalfedgeCIter 
			heCIter = halfedge()</code>, <code>HalfedgeCIter start = halfedge()</code>, and <code>Vector3D norUnitVec(0, 0, 0)</code>.
			Then, we run a do-while loop with the conditional <code>heCIter != start</code>, meaning that we will continue to loop until
			we have traversed the entire mesh and end up at our original, starting halfedge. Next, we find the three vertices associated with
			a face using the <code>vertex()</code>, <code>next()</code>, and <code>position</code> methods and variables associated with the
			halfedge class. Once we have all three vertices, we know that the normal of a face is defined by the vector that is perpendicular
			to the surface, so we can find the cross product of these two vectors to receive the third, normal vector. We implemented this step 
			by defining the vectors as <code>vertex3 - vertex1</code> and <code>vertex3 - vertex2</code> and finding the cross product of these
			vectors using the <code>cross()</code> method. We then add the normal vector to our <code>norUnitVec</code> variable. We iterate 
			to the next halfedge using <code>heCIter = heCIter->twin()->next()</code>, giving us the a new halfedge on an adjacent face.
		</p>

		<p>
			The screenshots below show the difference between default flat shading and phong shading (which we implemented by using
			area-weighted vertex normals). As we can clearly see, the phong shading is much smoother, where as the default flat shading
			has different colors contained to each face, making the image look blockier and the shading less smooth.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		
		<p>
			For this task, the way we implemented edge flips was first having a conditional that checks if the two faces that
			are adjacent to the passed in edge are not on the boundary. If they are, we do not perform an edge flip and return
			<code>e0</code>. If they are not on the boundary, we then store the six half edges that make up the two
			triangles of the edge we want to flip. Note that one of these halfedges is the twin of <code>e0</code>.
			Next, we store the two associated faces, four associated edges (not including <code>e0</code>), and four
			associated vertices. Afterwards, we use <code>setNeighbors()</code> to reset the associated <code>next</code>,
			<code>twin</code>, <code>vertex</code>, <code>edge</code>, and <code>face</code> for each of our six halfedges. We 
			need to do this because as we flip the edges, the relationship between these different parameters of a halfedge change
			and we need to update them accordingly. After we've updated the parameters of each halfedge, we need to update the 
			parameters of the two faces and the four vertices to make sure that they are associated with the correct halfedges
			after the edge flip occurs. Finally, we returned <code>e0</code>. An interesting implentation trick that we 
			used was making sure that we stored all relevant pointers, even if they didn't need to be updated. For example, we 
			stored all four edges in their own variables, even though we could have referenced them through pointers via the 
			haldedges. This helped us make sure that we weren't making any minor mistakes when referencing these variables later
			on. This ties into a helpful debugging tip; by explicitly storing our variables, it was easier to understand what was
			occurring at each step as opposed to getting confused between different pointers.

		<p>
			The debugging for this task was arduous! At first, whenever we flipped an edge, we would create a hole in our
			mesh. We knew that this was caused by a misplaced pointer, but with so many pointers, it was hard to determined 
			exactly what went wrong. We first started debugging by drawing out the edge flip. Drawing the 
			edge flip and explicitly labeling each relevant part made it easier for us to go through our code and make sure 
			that our pointers matched up. While this helped our understanding of the task, it did not resolve the error. Thus,
			our next debugging step was to be more deliberate in how we were defining our variables. Previously, we defined variables
			using other variables. For example, we had <code>HalfedgeCIter he1 = e0->halfedge()</code>, 
			<code> HalfedgeCIter he2 = he1->twin()</code>, <code>HalfedgeIter heCD = he2->next()</code>, 
			<code>HalfedgeIter heDB = heCD->next()</code>, etc. While this definitely would have worked, we found it difficult to 
			tell if our variables were storing the correct information. To counteract this, we stored everything relevant to 
			<code>e0</code>, <code>he1</code>, and <code>he2</code>. Through these two methods, we were able to find 
			inconsistencies in our pointers, allowing us to eventually debug this method.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		
		<p>
			We implemented task 5 in a very similar way to task 4. The first thing that we did was have a conditional check 
			whether or not if a face adjacent to the edge we're splitting is on the boundary. If it is, we return a VertexIter
			and do not split the edge. If it is not on the boundary, then we first define the four original vertices associated 
			with the two triangles on the mesh. Alongside the edge we want to split, we calculate the midpoint a place a fifth
			vertex there. Next, we store all of the original halfedges inside variables. For this method, we create eight new halfedges 
			(including twins). Next, we store the three new edges we must create and the given edge <code>e0</code> in variables. Finally,
			we store the original two faces and two new faces in variables. Next, we start setting the neighbors of each of the new 
			halfedges. We implemented this by setting each of the four triangles separately, creating four distinct cycles that made it
			easy for us to understand each pointer in the context of the edge split. Afterwards, we reassign all faces, edges, and vertices
			to new halfedges, even if the process is redundant, to ensure that all of the pointers are stored properly. Finally, we return
			the midpoint vertex <code>vM</code>. The main implementation trick that we performed for this task was making our code as
			legible as possible. We added several comments and most importantly, set the neighbors of each triangle in its own separate
			chunk, creating a cycle structure for the next pointers. This made it easy for us to quickly identify any misplaced pointers,
			speeding up the debugging process.

		<p>
			Our debugging journey wasn't as bad for task 5 as it was for task 4 as task 4 had taught us a lot about 
			best practices. We started by first drawing out a before and after diagram of an edge split, making sure to
			properly label all relevant edges, faces, vertices, and halfedges. Referencing our task 4 implementation, we 
			began to implement task 5. Our first iteration was extremely close with the only issue being two of the four 
			faces not rendering. After carefully going through all of our pointers and referencing our diagram, we found
			the pointers that we had defined incorrect with <code>setNeighbors</code> and were able to resolve the issue.
