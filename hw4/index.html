		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		
		<p>
			For this part, you can see the results of experimenting with different paramenters, such as the spring constant, damping, and density, in the 
			simulation.
		</p>

		<h3>Spring Constant (<code>ks</code>)</h3>

		<p>
			After running our simulation, we have observed that a lower spring constant results in the cloth behaving much more "loose-ly". The fabric stretches more,
			especially after it falls, and slowly settles into place. As it settles, it creates many visible, droopy waves. In constrast, a higher spring constant 
			correlates to a more rigid fabric. The fabric has less stretch, settling into place relatively quickly and maintaining its shape better. Thus, the 
			spring constant determines the stiffness and rigidity of the cloth. 
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2 - KSlow.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low Spring Constant (<code>ks</code> = 500 N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2 - KShigh.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>High Spring Constant (<code>ks</code> = 50000 N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Density</h3>

		<p>
			As the volume of the cloth remains constant, we know that as we increase the density, we increase the mass and as we decrease the density, we 
			decrase the mass of our object. This can be seen clearly in our simulations. For low values for density, we see that the cloth falls much slower and 
			the material reaches its final resting state very quickly. In constrast, for high values for density, the cloth falls quickly. The material stretches 
			a lot and takes longer to settle. It also moves in a more exaggerated fashion.
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2 - densityLow.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low Density (Density = 1 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2 - densityHigh.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>High Density (Density = 150 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Damping</h3>

		<p>
			Damping controls the speed that the fabric slows down as it moves from high velocity to rest. Lower values of damping result in the fabric 
			oscillating for longer periods of time, slow to lose engery before it eventually comes to rest. In constast, higher values of damping result 
			in the fabric coming to rest extremely quickly, having it stop smoothly and almost immediately. 
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2 - dampingLow.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low Damping (Damping = 0%)</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>High Damping (Damping = 1%)</figcaption>
				</td>

		<p>
			The image below shows the final resting state for our cloth. For this image, we used all of the default values provided (<code>ks</code> = 5000 N/m, density = 15 g/cm^2, 
			and damping = 0.2%).

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

		<p>
			When handling collisions, we needed to first add update our <code>simulate()</code> method to ensure that it knew how 
			to handle collisions with other primitives. This was accomplished by looping through all of the point masses, and then
			looping through every collision object. For each collision object, we check if it collides with a point mass by calling 
			<code>collide()</code>. We implemented collisions with spheres first. We did this by computing where the point masss
			intersects with the sphere by taking the norm of the origin minus the position of the point mass. Next, we check if 
			the intersection point is less than the radius. If it is, we know that clipping will occur, so we must adjust the 
			point accordingly. We do this by calculating the tangent of the intersection point. Using the tangent, we calculate 
			the correction vector. We scale the correction vector by <code>1 - friction</code> and add it to the last position of the 
			point mass, storing the result in the point mass's current position. Functionally, this causes the point mass's 
			position to update to the correct location, ensuring it is not clipping through the sphere. Our implementation for 
			planes is very similar. We calculate how far the point mass was from the plane at the last position and at the current 
			position, and take the dot product of each to see what side of the plane it is on. If the result of multiplying the last 
			and current position is less than or equal to 0, then we know the point has crossed the plane. If this is the case, we 
			find the direction that the point mass is moving in. Next, we calculate the tangent vector and add the 
			<code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code> to ensure that the point is slightly above the plane. We then calculate the correction vector 
			to ensure that we are moving the point to a position where it does not intersect with the plane. Like with the sphere, we 
			scale the correction vector by <code>1 - friction</code> and add the result to the point mass's last position, storing it 
			inside the point mass's current position.
		</p>

		<p>
			The images below show the results of changing the spring constant on the cloth. We can see that when
			<code>ks = 500</code>, the cloth is extremely floppy. It conforms to the shape of the sphere and has the most folds 
			and wrinkles when compared to the others. When <code>ks = 5000</code>, the cloth begins to gain some rigidity. While 
			it still has many folds and wrinkles, it conforms to the shape of the sphere much less, maintaining some of its own
			structure. Finally, when we set <code>ks = 50000</code>, we can see that the cloth is extremely rigid. Out of the 
			three images, it changes shape the least, barely conforming to the shape of the sphere, having the fewest amount of 
			wrinkles and folds, and overall looking more stiff.
		</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>

		<p>
			In order to implement self-collisions, we first needed to create a hash function with a good distribution. In order 
			to ensure that our hash function is evenly distributed, we calculate w, h, and t respectively and use <code>fmod()</code>
			to ensure that they are truncated to its coordinates in the closest 3D box. We then use these modded values in order 
			to create a unique hash key by multiplying them together with random constants. Next, we implement our 
			<code>self_collide()</code> function. We call our hashing function and check to see if that hash key is already stored 
			in the end of our map. If it is, we exit out of function. If not, we create a correction vector and a counter. We loop 
			through every point mass, and if we are not at our original, starting point mass, we calculate the distance from the 
			new point mass to the old point mass. If they are touching each other, we then calculate the direction, use the direction, 
			thicknes, and distance to calculate the correction vector, and increment our count by one. After we are finished looping 
			through all of the point masses, we check to see if there were any collisions (as in, our counter is greater than 0). If there 
			were, we divide our correction vector by count times the number of simulation steps and add the correction vector to the 
			point mass's current position, updating its location. Next, inside of our <code>build_spatial_map()</code> function, we 
			loop through all of the point masses, calculating their hash kets. If we find that their hash key is at the end of the map,
			we set the map's value at that key equal to a new point mass vector. Finally, we add the point nass to the end of our map 
			at that hash key. This all comes together in our <code>simulate()</code> function. Inside of simulate, we call 
			<code>build_spatial_map()</code>. Then, we loop through all of the point masses and call <code>self_collide</code> on each 
			one. 
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4 - early.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Early Stage in Self-Collision</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4 - mid.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Middle Stage in Self-Collision</figcaption>

				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task4 - final.png" width="300px"/>
					<figcaption>Final Stage in Self-Collision</figcaption>
				  </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>
			The grid of images below show what occurs in our self-collision simulation as we change our values for density 
			and the spring constant. First, when we use lower values for density, we can see that our cloth folds very smoothly, 
			with minimal excess wrinkles. The shape is much stiffer and rigid, holding its shape better. In contrast, when we use 
			higher values for density, we can see that our cloth has almost no rigidity. It has folded over itself many times,
			resulting in a resting state that is extremely wrinkled, crumpled up, and lacks any smoothness. Likewise, when we 
			use a lower value for the spring constant, we can see that our cloth also becomes more wrinkled, with many distinct 
			folds. In contrast, a higher value for the spring constant results in a cloth that is very smooth and rigid, maintaining
			much of its original shape.
