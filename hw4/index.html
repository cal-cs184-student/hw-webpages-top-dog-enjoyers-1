		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>
			Throughout this homework, we learned how to implement a real-time simulation of cloth using a mass and spring based system. 
			We first created our mass and spring system, which worked by building a grid of masses and springs, allowing us to create 
			a cloth model for simulation. Next, we implemented simulation through creating physical simulations of motion to apply 
			different forces to our models. This was accomplished through Verlet Integration. We added collisions with other objects
			(spheres and planes) to add more realism to our simulation. Next, we implemented self-collision, ensuring that the cloth 
			doesn't clip strangely when falling in on itself. Finally, we implemented different custom shaders that allow us to 
			render lighting in our simulation. Both of us found this homework to be the most fun and interesting one yet! It was super 
			rewarding to see how everything we learned in this class came together in this project. We loved implementing each task, 
			laughing when things broke when the simulation began, and celebrated when each section worked! This homework taught us a 
			lot about simulations in computer graphics.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		
		<p>
			For this part, you can see the results of experimenting with different paramenters, such as the spring constant, damping, and density, in the 
			simulation.
		</p>

		<h3>Spring Constant (<code>ks</code>)</h3>

		<p>
			After running our simulation, we have observed that a lower spring constant results in the cloth behaving much more "loose-ly". The fabric stretches more,
			especially after it falls, and slowly settles into place. As it settles, it creates many visible, droopy waves. In constrast, a higher spring constant 
			correlates to a more rigid fabric. The fabric has less stretch, settling into place relatively quickly and maintaining its shape better. Thus, the 
			spring constant determines the stiffness and rigidity of the cloth. 
		</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <figcaption>High Spring Constant for Pinned 4 (<code>ks</code> = 50000 N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Density</h3>

		<p>
			As the volume of the cloth remains constant, we know that as we increase the density, we increase the mass and as we decrease the density, we 
			decrase the mass of our object. This can be seen clearly in our simulations. For low values for density, we see that the cloth falls much slower and 
			the material reaches its final resting state very quickly. In constrast, for high values for density, the cloth falls quickly. The material stretches 
			a lot and takes longer to settle. It also moves in a more exaggerated fashion.
		</p>

				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Damping</h3>

		<p>
			Damping controls the speed that the fabric slows down as it moves from high velocity to rest. Lower values of damping result in the fabric 
			oscillating for longer periods of time, slow to lose engery before it eventually comes to rest. In constast, higher values of damping result 
			in the fabric coming to rest extremely quickly, having it stop smoothly and almost immediately. 
		</p>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

		<p>
			When handling collisions, we needed to first add update our <code>simulate()</code> method to ensure that it knew how 
			to handle collisions with other primitives. This was accomplished by looping through all of the point masses, and then
			looping through every collision object. For each collision object, we check if it collides with a point mass by calling 
			<code>collide()</code>. We implemented collisions with spheres first. We did this by computing where the point masss
			intersects with the sphere by taking the norm of the origin minus the position of the point mass. Next, we check if 
			the intersection point is less than the radius. If it is, we know that clipping will occur, so we must adjust the 
			point accordingly. We do this by calculating the tangent of the intersection point. Using the tangent, we calculate 
			the correction vector. We scale the correction vector by <code>1 - friction</code> and add it to the last position of the 
			point mass, storing the result in the point mass's current position. Functionally, this causes the point mass's 
			position to update to the correct location, ensuring it is not clipping through the sphere. Our implementation for 
			planes is very similar. We calculate how far the point mass was from the plane at the last position and at the current 
			position, and take the dot product of each to see what side of the plane it is on. If the result of multiplying the last 
			and current position is less than or equal to 0, then we know the point has crossed the plane. If this is the case, we 
			find the direction that the point mass is moving in. Next, we calculate the tangent vector and add the 
			<code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code> to ensure that the point is slightly above the plane. We then calculate the correction vector 
			to ensure that we are moving the point to a position where it does not intersect with the plane. Like with the sphere, we 
			scale the correction vector by <code>1 - friction</code> and add the result to the point mass's last position, storing it 
			inside the point mass's current position.
		</p>

		<p>
			The images below show the results of changing the spring constant on the cloth. We can see that when
			<code>ks = 500</code>, the cloth is extremely floppy. It conforms to the shape of the sphere and has the most folds 
			and wrinkles when compared to the others. When <code>ks = 5000</code>, the cloth begins to gain some rigidity. While 
			it still has many folds and wrinkles, it conforms to the shape of the sphere much less, maintaining some of its own
			structure. Finally, when we set <code>ks = 50000</code>, we can see that the cloth is extremely rigid. Out of the 
			three images, it changes shape the least, barely conforming to the shape of the sphere, having the fewest amount of 
			wrinkles and folds, and overall looking more stiff.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>

		<p>
			In order to implement self-collisions, we first needed to create a hash function with a good distribution. In order 
			to ensure that our hash function is evenly distributed, we calculate w, h, and t respectively and use <code>fmod()</code>
			to ensure that they are truncated to its coordinates in the closest 3D box. We then use these modded values in order 
			to create a unique hash key by multiplying them together with random constants. Next, we implement our 
			<code>self_collide()</code> function. We call our hashing function and check to see if that hash key is already stored 
			in the end of our map. If it is, we exit out of function. If not, we create a correction vector and a counter. We loop 
			through every point mass, and if we are not at our original, starting point mass, we calculate the distance from the 
			new point mass to the old point mass. If they are touching each other, we then calculate the direction, use the direction, 
			thicknes, and distance to calculate the correction vector, and increment our count by one. After we are finished looping 
			through all of the point masses, we check to see if there were any collisions (as in, our counter is greater than 0). If there 
			were, we divide our correction vector by count times the number of simulation steps and add the correction vector to the 
			point mass's current position, updating its location. Next, inside of our <code>build_spatial_map()</code> function, we 
			loop through all of the point masses, calculating their hash kets. If we find that their hash key is at the end of the map,
			we set the map's value at that key equal to a new point mass vector. Finally, we add the point nass to the end of our map 
			at that hash key. This all comes together in our <code>simulate()</code> function. Inside of simulate, we call 
			<code>build_spatial_map()</code>. Then, we loop through all of the point masses and call <code>self_collide</code> on each 
			one.

		<p>
			The grid of images below show what occurs in our self-collision simulation as we change our values for density 
			and the spring constant. First, when we use lower values for density, we can see that our cloth folds very smoothly, 
			with minimal excess wrinkles. The shape is much stiffer and rigid, holding its shape better. In contrast, when we use 
			higher values for density, we can see that our cloth has almost no rigidity. It has folded over itself many times,
			resulting in a resting state that is extremely wrinkled, crumpled up, and lacks any smoothness. Likewise, when we 
			use a lower value for the spring constant, we can see that our cloth also becomes more wrinkled, with many distinct 
			folds. In contrast, a higher value for the spring constant results in a cloth that is very smooth and rigid, maintaining
			much of its original shape.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		
		<p>
			A shader program is a program that controls how things are rendered. Specifically, it uses vertex and fragment shaders 
			that work together in the rendering pipeline to take models and add a stylized layer of rendering to them. Vertex 
			shaders work for each vertex in a 3D model. They pass in information such as color, normal direction, and tecture coordinates. 
			They also determine how each vertex should look if we apply a transformation to it. Next, we have fragment shaders. 
			Fragment shaders work with individual pixels in a 3D model. They use lighting, material properties, and texture to decide
			how each pixel should appear. When combined, they create visual effects by determining how light interacts with materials.
		</p>

		<p>
			Blinn Phong shading is a model that simulates soft lighting, shading, and shininess. It works by combining three 
			different lighting models. The first is ambient lighting, which is the base color of an object. This helps to simulate 
			indirect light scattered and is visible even in shadow. Next, we have diffuse lighting. Diffuse lighting simulates 
			light hitting the surface of a 3D model. It is stronger when it hits the model directly and weaker as we move further 
			away from the light source, creating a more realistic lighting feel. Finally, we have specular lighting. This creates 
			a shiny light that reflects off of a model's surface. By adjusting the different levels for each of the three sources of 
			lighting, we can create different levels of light and shininess in our Blinn Phong shading.

			The images below show bump and displacement mapping on the cloth, sphere, and cloth draped over the sphere. Bump
			mapping works by creating the illusion of bumps and depth on a 3D model using lighting effects. Notably, it does 
			not change the actual surface geometry of the model. It works by using a normal map to create fake bumps and dents by 
			altering the way that light reflects off of the 3D model, giving the illusion of texture. In contrast, displacement
			mapping actually modifies the mesh of our 3D model to create texture. It pushes the location of vertices based off 
			of a height map. Notably, because the geometry is physically altered, the 3D model now has real depth.

			The images below show how changing the sphere mesh's coarseness effects bump and displacement mapping. For bump 
			mapping, we can see that there is close to no different as we increase the coarseness from 16 to 128. This is 
			because bump mapping does not actually change the mesh's geometry; because the bumps are created from illusions in 
			the lighting, the bumps themselves don't actually depend on the coarseness of the mesh's geometry. In contrast, we 
			can see a notable difference in displacement mapping. When we set the coarseness equal to 16 for displacement 
			mapping, we can see that the low number of vertices means that there isn't much geometry to manipulate, causing 
			the sphere to look blocky. However, when we see the coarseness to 128, the image becomes more realistic. The bumps 
			on the sphere are more defined and detailed as the additional points in the geometry allow us to add more detail.

			The images below show the custom shader that we implemented for extra credit. For this task, we decided to add 
			color controls to our Blinn Phong shader. Using the color wheel, we are able to set the model to be any color 
			we want it to be. We implemented this by taking copying our code from the Blinn Phong shader. We then added multiplied
			<code>u_color.rgb</code> by the sum of the ambient and diffuse lighting and added the specular lighting at the end. We
			stored the result in the xyz component of <code>out_color</code> and set <code>out_color.a = u_color.a</code>.
